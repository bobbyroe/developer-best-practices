      <h1>Web Developer Best Practices</h1>
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to learn more about building accessible web experiences, you’ve come to the
        right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contents here are based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a>’s
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
          target="_blank"
          >WCAG 2.1</a
        >). Our goal is to provide the simplest and most effective best practices on how to design,
        implement and test web applications with accessibility firmly in mind.
      </p>
      <h2 id="why">Why is digital accessibility important?</h2>
      <p>
        Inclusion is a core value here at T-Mobile, so we foster environment of inclusiveness for
        all customers and employees. About 25% of our customers have some form of disability
        (Visual, Auditory, Motor, Cognitive or Vestibular). Digital accessibility is the degree to
        which a website or application is useable to as many people as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility defects are legal liabilities. T-Mobile websites and applications which are
        inaccessible open the company up to legal liabilities, from FCC complaints to ADA lawsuits,
        and can cost us millions.
      </p>
      <p>
        T-Mobile will never become the innovative company we want to be if we continue to add
        accessibility defects to the backlog.
      </p>
      <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
      <p>
        For creating web apps with accessibility in mind, you’ll need to get familiar with the basic
        concepts and have some specific tools at hand. Let’s go over how to get set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud891" target="_blank">Udacity</a> offers a
        superb, free course on Web Accessibility. Please watch at least the first 2 sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re not running a Windows system yet, please work through the setup steps here:
        <a href="https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/setup/windows/" target="_blank"
          >Window operating system setup</a
        >. A Windows operating system machine is essential – most users with special needs have
        Windows-specific software running – like it or not.
      </p>

        The most widley used screen reader, currently is
        <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/" target="_blank">JAWS</a
        >. You can download and install the trial version.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, visit the Chrome Web store to get the
        <a
          href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk"
          target="_blank"
          >Lighthouse</a
        >
        extension. Lighthouse adds automated accessibility (and other) scans to Chrome.
      </p>
      <h2 id="process">Invite an accessibility coach into the process</h2>
      <p>
        The best time to bring a coach into the process is <em>as soon as</em> it makes sense. The
        closer that is to the start of development, the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        During planning, please reject stories that do not have defined accessibility acceptance
        criteria for UX/UI work. And be sure that your stories are sized with accessibility work
        included.
      </p>
      <h2 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        To begin developing accessible web apps, you need to understand how our customers use them,
        and how to optimize for their specific needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        First thing we need to talk about is plain, traditional HTML. You may feel that being a
        serious senior full stack developer, this topic will have nothing new to offer. Turns out
        that most accessibility problems are the result of just bad HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re probably accustomed to reading and using a web application on a traditional screen
        and control it with a mouse and keyboard. But, you may not realize that a surprisingly large
        group of customers rely on alternate devices to access the same information. So,

          target="_blank"
          >get familiar with the fundamentals of those</a
        >: how they work, how they are commonly used and what to pay attention to when providing
        support for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you read on, be sure to keep in mind that common knowledge of accessibility is full
        of misunderstandings, half-truths and technical oddities. This guide attempts to be fool
        proof and give the best answers to the most relevant questions.

              Many customers cannot use a pointing device (like a mouse), so they rely on a
              keyboard. Thus your software must be fully functional with a keyboard only.

        Keyboard accessibility is one of the most important aspects of web accessibility. As you
        develop and iterate, test your work using a
        <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/" target="_blank">keyboard to navigate</a>
        though the user interface.
