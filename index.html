      <h1>Developer Best Practices</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to learn more about building fully accessible web experiences, you’ve come to
        the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contents here are based on the W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).
        Our goal is to provide the simplest and most effective best practices on how to design,
        implement and test web applications with accessibility firmly in mind.
      </p>
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <p>
        For creating web apps with accessibility in mind, you’ll need some specific tools at hand.
        Let’s go over how to get set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Windows operating system machine is essential – most users with special needs have
        Windows-specific software running – like it or not.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firefox</li>
        <li>NVDA</li>
        <li>Etc ...</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        To begin developing accessible web apps, you need to understand how our customers use them,
        and how to optimize for their specific needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        First thing we need to talk about is plain, traditional HTML. You may feel that being a
        serious senior full stack developer, this topic will have nothing new to offer. Turns out
        ‘though that most accessibility problems are the result of just bad HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re probably accustomed to reading and using a web application on a traditional screen
        and control it with a mouse and keyboard. You may not realize that a surprisingly large
        group of customers rely on alternate devices to access the same information. So, get
        familiar with the fundamentals of those: how they work, how they are commonly used and what
        to pay attention to when providing support for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you read on, be sure to keep in mind that common knowledge of accessibility is full
        of misunderstandings, half-truths and technical oddities. This guide attempts to be fool
        proof and give the best answers to the most relevant questions.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Many customers cannot use a pointing device (like a mouse), so they rely on a
              keyboard. Thus your software must be fully functional with a keyboard only.
