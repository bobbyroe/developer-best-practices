      <h1>Developer Best Practices</h1>
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to learn more about building fully accessible web experiences, you’ve come to
        the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contents here are based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a>’s
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"
          target="_blank"
          >WCAG 2.1</a
        >). Our goal is to provide the simplest and most effective best practices on how to design,
        implement and test web applications with accessibility firmly in mind.
      </p>
      <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
      <p>
        For creating web apps with accessibility in mind, you’ll need some specific tools at hand.
        Let’s go over how to get set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll need to work through the following list which will guide you to the minimum required
        software needed for a well-working environment. If you’re not running a Windows system yet,
        please work through the setup steps here:

          >Window operating system setup</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Windows operating system machine is essential – most users with special needs have
        Windows-specific software running – like it or not.

      <h2 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        To begin developing accessible web apps, you need to understand how our customers use them,
        and how to optimize for their specific needs.
      </p>
      <h3>Invite an accessibility coach into the process</h3>
      <p>
        The best time to bring an a11y coach into the process is as soon at it makes sense. The
        closer that is to the start of development, the better.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        First thing we need to talk about is plain, traditional HTML. You may feel that being a
        serious senior full stack developer, this topic will have nothing new to offer. Turns out
        ‘though that most accessibility problems are the result of just bad HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re probably accustomed to reading and using a web application on a traditional screen
        and control it with a mouse and keyboard. You may not realize that a surprisingly large
        group of customers rely on alternate devices to access the same information. So, get
        familiar with the fundamentals of those: how they work, how they are commonly used and what
        to pay attention to when providing support for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you read on, be sure to keep in mind that common knowledge of accessibility is full
        of misunderstandings, half-truths and technical oddities. This guide attempts to be fool
        proof and give the best answers to the most relevant questions.

              Many customers cannot use a pointing device (like a mouse), so they rely on a
              keyboard. Thus your software must be fully functional with a keyboard only.
